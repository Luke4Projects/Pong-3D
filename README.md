# Pong-3D
Pong made in C++ with OpenGL, with a 3D perspective added to it.

To build, you will need to edit the CMakeLists.txt to have your include and link directories. You will also need to build the libraries for it, which you can find in the libraries directory. I have only tested it on Windows 10, compiled with Visual Studio 2019.
